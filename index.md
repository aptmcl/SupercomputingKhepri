# __Architecture in the Supercomputing Era__

Algorithmic design, analysis, optimization, and visualization depend
on the use of computers and, frequently, have considerable
computational demands. Nowadays, it is not unusual to have algorithmic
processes running for weeks in high-performance computer
workstations. Obviously, the duration of these processes often deters
architects and engineers from their use.

These processes mostly use the same algorithmic approaches that were
developed when computers operated with a single processing
unit. Nowadays, we are reaching the physical limits of the
computational power of a single processing unit. Therefore, to
increase performance, computers now include multiple processing
units. To take advantage of this parallelized form of computational
power, we need to adapt the algorithmic processes of the past or
invent new ones.

With that goal in mind, we proposed a short two-month project to
experiment with the parallelization of algorithmic design, analysis,
optimization, and visualization using a super-computer with a very
large number of processing units. This allowed us to measure the
scalability of those algorithmic processes relative to the number of
processing units used, and more effectively develop the necessary
adaptations to take advantage of the parallelism available in current
computers.

This report summarizes the results of project __MOOB - Multi-Objective
Optimization of Buildings__.  MOOB was a winning candidate on the
_Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia_ (FCT) Call for Advanced
Computing Projects, which offered computing time in one of Portugal's
supercomputing centers.  The report in divided in six parts:

* [Introduction](/page1/)
* [Julia for Parallel Processing](/page2/)
* [Design Exploration](/page3/)
* [Optimization](/page4/)
* [Rendering](/page5/)
* [Conclusions](/page6/)
