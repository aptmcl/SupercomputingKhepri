More specifically, we have been researching in Algorithmic Design, Algorithmic Analysis, Algorithmic Optimization, and Algorithmic Visualization. Algorithmic Design focus on the use of algorithms that generate designs, particularly, building designs. Algorithmic Analysis deals with the automation of analysis processes, such as lighting analysis or structural analysis. Algorithmic Optimization takes advantage of the two previous areas to optimize building designs according to given metrics, e.g., structural performance. Finally, Algorithmic Visualization is concerned with the algorithmic exploration of cinematographic techniques to generate images and films of building designs.</p> <p>Some of the previous areas have considerable computational demands. Algorithmic optimization and Algorithmic Visualization, in particular, are extremely demanding from the computational point of view: it is not unusual to have processes running for weeks in high-performance computer workstations. Obviously, the typical duration of these processes makes it less likely that architects and engineers are eager to wait for so long for their completion and, thus, they end up not using them.</p> <p>However, when we consider the evolution of the performance of the computing systems, we verify that an enormous increase in computation power occurred in the last decades. First, by increasing the number of instructions a processors could execute in a given amount of time and, then, by increasing the number of processors. The software that nowadays runs on a mobile phone, decades ago required large rooms full of hardware with huge energy demands.</p> <p>This shows that we should not take the currently available computational power as the norm but only as another data point in the trend for increasingly larger computational power. This point of view is particularly relevant because it allows us to forecast future computational power and to realize that what is nowadays out of reach for commodity hardware but is already possible in supercomputing devices will, in the near future, be possible in commodity hardware.</p> <p>It was with this perception that we submitted an application for the FCT Call on Advanced Computing Projects, which gave us the opportunity to use the High-Performance Computing &#40;HPC&#41; capability provided by one of Portugal&#39;s supercomputing centers. Our goal was to look at some of our previous and current research, from which we already had data regarding their computational demands, and re-execute the associated programs in a supercomputer, to assess the effective gains. It was also important for us to evaluate the experience of using a supercomputer, as these tend to run operating systems with very specific characteristics and that differ significantly from those of a typical off-the-shelf computer.</p> <h3 id=commodity_hardware ><a href="#commodity_hardware" class=header-anchor >Commodity Hardware</a></h3> <p>Throughout the time, our research has produced a series of programs and programming environments. Given the area, it is not surprising to verify that many of them are intended to be used through a graphical user interface. In general, for most of their activities, our researchers use laptops that have obvious computing power limitations.</p> <p>For the most demanding computations, the highest-powered system we used was a 2-CPU/16-core/64 GB RAM workstation running Windows-10. This workstation was used, mostly, for tasks where user attention was not critical, such as optimization and rendering. It was not unusual for some of these tasks to require days or weeks of computation.</p> <p>Despite the fact that, several years ago, these tasks would take months to complete, this was no consolation when results were needed as soon as possible. Nowadays, users do not want to wait more than one day and that is already assuming that the task will be done overnight so that results are available in the morning.</p> <h3 id=the_supercomputing_hardware ><a href="#the_supercomputing_hardware" class=header-anchor >The Supercomputing Hardware</a></h3> <p>Upon approval of our application to the FCT Call on Advanced Computing Projects, we were given access to the Cirrus supercomputer, more specifically, the <code>fct</code> partition containing four computing nodes, each node providing 96 AMD EPYC 7552 cores, running at 2.2 GHz and accessing 512 GB of RAM. In total, this partition allows 384 simultaneous threads of execution, using 2 TB of memory, although these would be constrained by the supercomputer topology and the available resources at each moment. In any case, this represents a significant amount of computing power when compared with current commodity hardware that, typically, can simultaneously execute only 8 threads of execution using 16 GB of RAM.</p> <p>It is also important to mention that users to not have direct access to the computing nodes. Instead, they have to use a front-end machine with an Intel Xeon CPU L5420 running at 2.5GHz with 32 GB of RAM.</p> <h3 id=the_supercomputing_software ><a href="#the_supercomputing_software" class=header-anchor >The Supercomputing Software</a></h3> <p>Despite the large differences between the hardware of the Cirrus supercomputer and that of a typical laptop, the differences in software were even bigger and caused the biggest headaches. First, because the supercomputer uses CentOS 7, an operating system that is very different from the most popular ones, such as Microsoft&#39;s Windows or Apple&#39;s MacOS. Second, because it mostly operates in <em>batch mode</em>, meaning that <em>scripts</em> must be submitted describing the intended executions and the resources needed, and there is no immediate feedback, for example, to report errors in the code. Third, the <em>batch mode</em> also implies that it only supports programs that do not require interacting with the user and, therefore, do not use a graphical user interface.</p> <p>This mode of operation is supported by Slurm&#39;s job scheduling system. Slurm is an open source cluster management system that is very popular. This helps significantly, as there is a ton of information available about Slurm.</p> <p>Creating the Slurm <em>script</em> is easy. For our experiments, we used the following template:</p> <pre><code class="julia hljs"><span class=hljs-comment >#!/bin/bash</span>

<span class=hljs-comment >#SBATCH --job-name=&lt;the job name&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-comment >#SBATCH --time=&lt;the time limit&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-comment >#SBATCH --nodes=&lt;number of nodes&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-comment >#SBATCH --ntasks=&lt;number of tasks&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-comment >#SBATCH -p &lt;my partition identifier&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-comment >#SBATCH -q &lt;my qos identifier&gt;</span>

&lt;<span class=hljs-keyword >do</span> something, maybe <span class=hljs-keyword >using</span> some environment variables, such as $SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE&gt;</code></pre> <p>Note that anything that starts with <code>#SBATCH</code> is treated as relevant information for Slurm. Note also that this information does not affect the script because a line that starts with <code>#</code> is treated as a comment by <code>bash</code>. In this particular script we specified just some of the job&#39;s parameters but there are many other options that can be provided.</p> <h3 id=the_plan ><a href="#the_plan" class=header-anchor >The Plan</a></h3> <p>Given that the available HPC resources are running Linux variants which are very different from the Windows 10 operating system that constitutes the usual environment for Khepri, the first step would be to convert our software to Linux. Some of the required analysis tools already run in Linux &#40;e.g. Radiance, Frame3DD&#41; but others would need to be converted. We expect that this conversion would not need the use of the advanced computing resources except for testing.</p> <p>After that step, we planned to test the Julia programming language capabilities for HPC. Although there are studies that show that Julia is a good fit for those computing environments, we still need to get some experience in that kind of use.</p> <p>After having Julia running on the supercomputer, we planned to explore the Julia language to adapt our software to not only manage multiple parallel runs of sequential optimization algorithms but also use parallel optimization algorithms or open-source optimization frameworks supporting parallelization.</p> <p>Finally, if there was still time available, we would experiment running Khepri and some of their backends in the supercomputer to evaluate its scalability on different tasks, particularly, analysis, and visualization.</p> <p>However, given the fact that some of Khepri&#39;s backends only work in Windows, we had to select only those that we knew, in advance, that we could have running in Linux.</p> <p>To this end, the plan required the following installation steps:</p> <ol> <li><p>Install the Julia language</p> <li><p>Install the KhepriBase package</p> <li><p>Install the BlackBoxOptim package, for multi- and single-objective optimization using meta-heuristic algorithms</p> <li><p>Install the KhepriFrame3DD package, for structural analysis</p> <li><p>Install the KhepriBlender and/or the KhepriPOVRay packages, for rendering</p> </ol> <p>Unfortunately, as we will see, installing even this small selection of programs was far from trivial.</p> <h3 id=installing_software ><a href="#installing_software" class=header-anchor >Installing Software</a></h3> <p>A major difficulty for accomplishing the plan is the lack of administrative privileges, as it prevents the system-wide installation of much needed libraries or software tools. Although entirely understandable due to the shared nature of the system, lacking these privileges makes it mandatory to use local installations. Fortunately, some of the critical software that we planned to use, such as the Julia programming language, can be installed locally.</p> <p>Initially, we tried to use the release candidate version of Julia version 1.6 because it promised to solve a pre-compilation problem that occurred when multiple simultaneous Julia processes attempted to pre-compile the software, triggering conflicts in the saving of the compiled code to disk. However, this version caused problems related to the foreign function interface that was critical for calling our own DLL implementation of the structural analysis package Frame3DD.</p> <p>After these failures, we went back to version 1.5.3, which we installed locally, using the official version for Linux and FreeBSD, hoping that the mentioned synchronization problems would not prevent us from doing the planned experiments.</p> <p>Unfortunately, not all software can be installed this way, making it impossible to do some of the planned experiments. The first casualty was Blender. Although there is a CentOS version of Blender, its installation requires administrative privileges. We spend some time trying alternative ways to install Blender but, given the limited time available, we moved on to the next alternative – POVRay.</p> <h3 id=recompiling_software ><a href="#recompiling_software" class=header-anchor >Recompiling Software</a></h3> <p>Not all software that is available for Linux &#40;or, more specifically, Ubuntu&#41; can directly run on the supercomputer. Some can only run after being recompiled for CentOS 7. Given the difficulty of using the frontend for anything more complex than just editing files or submitting jobs, we decided to recompile the software on our own machines and only move the resulting binaries to the supercomputer. In the beginning we were doing this using a Ubuntu installation running on Windows Subsystem for Linux &#40;WSL&#41;, which we expect would be very similar to CentOS. However, we quickly discovered that there were errors related to differences in the libraries of Ubuntu and CentOS 7. To avoid being forced to recompile the software, we initially attempted to solve these dependency errors but soon realized that it would not end up well.</p> <p>In the end, to avoid errors due to different software versions, we installed the exact same operating system on a virtual machine. This allowed us to more easily recompile the software, and only after successfully testing them on our own virtual machine, to move it to the supercomputer. At that moment, however, we discovered that despite running the exact same operating system, executing some of the recompiled programs in the frontend computer triggered an <code>Illegal instruction</code> error. After much unsuccessful debugging, we discovered that these errors did not occur when the programs were executed in the computing nodes.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the time and effort spent making just one of the programs run on the supercomputer consumed a significant fraction of the time that was given us to use the machine. To avoiding wasting the entire time just on the task of making the programs run, we decided to focus on those programs that we had already running and we start collecting statistics of their execution using a different number of processing units.</p> <h2 id=julia_for_parallel_processing ><a href="#julia_for_parallel_processing" class=header-anchor >Julia for Parallel Processing</a></h2> <p>Before anything else, we decided to gain some experience in the use of Julia&#39;s parallel processing capabilities.</p> <p>Julia supports multi-threading and distributed computing. Multi-threading allows multiple tasks to run simultaneously on more than one thread or CPU core, sharing memory, while distributed computing runs multiple processes with separate memory spaces, possibly on different machines. Given that Khepri is not thread-safe, we were particularly interested in testing the distributed computing capabilities. These are provided by the <code>Distributed</code> standard library as well as external packages such as <code>MPI.jl</code> and <code>DistributedArrays.jl</code>.</p> <p>The <code>Distributed</code> approach is based on the idea that one <em>master</em> process launches a set of <em>slave</em> processes, called workers, using the <code>addprocs</code> function, to which it distributes units of work, waiting for their completion. Despite being part of the standard library, the <code>Distributed</code> module must be explicitly loaded on the master process to access the <code>addprocs</code> function. The module is automatically loaded on the worker processes.</p> <h3 id=an_embarrassingly_parallel_problem ><a href="#an_embarrassingly_parallel_problem" class=header-anchor >An Embarrassingly Parallel Problem</a></h3> <p>The first tests attempted to determine how the Julia language implementation scales across multiple cores.

Immediately after its creation, each of the workers creates a TCP/IP connection, writes on standard output the corresponding host and port, and starts listening on that port. The master receives the output of each worker and completes the TCP/IP connection to each one. Then, it informs each worker of the connection point of all other workers, so that they can establish connections between themselves. To do this, each worker connects to all workers whose id is less than its own id.</p> <p>Given that all these connections require time to establish, we decided to measure its impact in the time and allocate memory as the number of processes is increased.

We defined the <code>p_approxi_pi</code> function that helps the distribution by dividing the intended number of iterations between the workers and then computing the <code>mean</code> of the results that came from the workers.</p> <pre><code class="julia hljs">p_approx_pi(n) =
  mean(pmap(n-&gt;approx_pi(n),

<span class=hljs-keyword >end</span></code></pre> <p>Note that, with this scheme, when we use two processes, we are in fact using just one worker, as the other one is just managing the distribution of work and collection of results. In the next plot, we also superimpose the results for the single-threaded case.</p> <div id=fdpual  style="width:600px;height:350px"></div> <script> var fig =

Another hypothesis is that, despite the number of workers created, Julia is not taking advantage of them because it does not fairly distribute the work among them. To refute &#40;or confirm&#41; this hypothesis, we decide to make a different test.</p> <p>The goal, now, is to distribute identical work units among the workers and collect the number of units that were processed by each worker. To that end, we used the following program:</p> <pre><code class="julia hljs"><span class=hljs-keyword >using</span> Distributed
addprocs(parse(<span class=hljs-built_in >Int</span>, <span class=hljs-literal >ARGS</span>[<span class=hljs-number >1</span>])-<span class=hljs-number >1</span>)

<span class=hljs-meta >@everywhere</span> work(x) = (sleep(<span class=hljs-number >0.01</span>); myid())
res = <span class=hljs-meta >@time</span> pmap(work, <span class=hljs-number >1</span>:<span class=hljs-number >2000</span>)</code></pre> <p>Note that the work unit of each process is just a quick <code>sleep</code>. Each process then returns its own <em>id</em>. The master, besides repeatedly sending elements of the range <code>1:2000</code> to the available workers, collects the results. This means that the range ends up being converted into an array of process <em>id</em>s, where each <em>id</em> represents the process that handled that work unit.</p> <p>After the range is exhausted, the array of <em>id</em>s is processed to count the number of times each <em>id</em> shows up. If the distribution is fair, all processes will have more or less the same number of occurrences in the array, meaning that all of them had to process a similar number of work units.</p> <pre><code class="julia hljs">distr = <span class=hljs-built_in >Dict</span>([i=&gt;<span class=hljs-number >0</span> <span class=hljs-keyword >for</span> i <span class=hljs-keyword >in</span> workers()])
<span class=hljs-keyword >for</span> i <span class=hljs-keyword >in</span> res
 distr[i]+=<span class=hljs-number >1</span>
<span class=hljs-keyword >end</span></code></pre> <p>Finally, for each process <em>id</em> we print the number of times it occurred in the array, i.e., the number of work units that it had to process.</p> <pre><code class="julia hljs"><span class=hljs-keyword >for</span> i <span class=hljs-keyword >in</span> workers()

<span class=hljs-keyword >end</span></code></pre> <p>In the following bar graph, we plot that number for each process, whose <em>id</em> is presented on the horizontal axis.</p> <div id=fdpjfl

Obviously, our example has other parts that cannot be parallelized.</p> <h2 id=design_exploration ><a href="#design_exploration" class=header-anchor >Design Exploration</a></h2> <p>Design space exploration is one of the simplest applications of supercomputing. The idea is to study the impact of a parameter in the performance of a given design. By dividing the domain of the parameter among different computing threads, it becomes possible to do multiple performance evaluations at the same time, each using a different design generated from that parameter.</p> <p>To evaluate the benefits of the approach, we decided to experiment the design space exploration of a simple truss structure. We were interested in simulating the behavior of the structure as different parameters were changed. To have a metric for the structural performance, we focused on the maximum displacement of the structure elements.</p> <p>Khepri supports two different structural analysis backends, namely KhepriRobot that connects to AutoDesk&#39;s Robot and KhepriFrame3DD, which directly accesses a DLL that wraps Frame3DD, static and dynamic structural analysis package for 2D and 3D frames, developed by Prof. Henri P. Gavin of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering of Duke University. Given that Robot does not work in non-Windows environments while Frame3DD does not require a graphical user interface, the choice for Khepri&#39;s backend KhepriFrame3DD was obvious.</p> <p>Inspired by Gaudi&#39;s ideas, we decided to create a truss where each of the truss&#39; legs is defined by a catenary that connects the leg endpoints. The legs are interconnected using different schemes, for example, just a single bar between corresponding pairs of nodes, or diagonal bars between pairs of pairs of nodes. To make the example more interesting, we decided to design a truss made of Bamboo, placed on a slab with a randomized outline, as follows:</p> <img src="/SupercomputingKhepri/output/VDomeTrussRibsDeform2-frame-000.png" alt=""> <p>This means that the truss does not have an axis of symmetry and, therefore, will be less resistant. For the structural simulation we used an approximation of the material properties of Bamboo, namely, a Young&#39;s modulus of <span class=katex ><span class=katex-mathml ><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1.39</mn><mi>G</mi><mi>P</mi><mi>a</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">E=1.39 GPa</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=katex-html  aria-hidden=true ><span class=base ><span class=strut  style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">E</span><span class=mspace  style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class=mrel >=</span><span class=mspace  style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class=base ><span class=strut  style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class=mord >1</span><span class=mord >.</span><span class=mord >3</span><span class=mord >9</span><span class="mord mathnormal">G</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">P</span><span class="mord mathnormal">a</span></span></span></span>, a Kirchoff&#39;s modulus of <span class=katex ><span class=katex-mathml ><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0.64</mn><mi>G</mi><mi>P</mi><mi>a</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">G=0.64 GPa</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=katex-html  aria-hidden=true ><span class=base ><span class=strut  style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">G</span><span class=mspace  style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class=mrel >=</span><span class=mspace  style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class=base ><span class=strut  style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class=mord >0</span><span class=mord >.</span><span class=mord >6</span><span class=mord >4</span><span class="mord mathnormal">G</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">P</span><span class="mord mathnormal">a</span></span></span></span>, and a density of <span class=katex ><span class=katex-mathml ><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>5880.0</mn><mi>K</mi><mi>g</mi><mi mathvariant=normal >/</mi><msup><mi>m</mi><mn>3</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">d=5880.0 Kg/m^3</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=katex-html  aria-hidden=true ><span class=base ><span class=strut  style="height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">d</span><span class=mspace  style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class=mrel >=</span><span class=mspace  style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class=base ><span class=strut  style="height:1.064108em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class=mord >5</span><span class=mord >8</span><span class=mord >8</span><span class=mord >0</span><span class=mord >.</span><span class=mord >0</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07153em;">K</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">g</span><span class=mord >/</span><span class=mord ><span class="mord mathnormal">m</span><span class=msupsub ><span class=vlist-t ><span class=vlist-r ><span class=vlist  style="height:0.8141079999999999em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class=pstrut  style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">3</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>.</p> <p>Our first experiment was to test a vertical load of increasing magnitude being applied to all the non-supported truss nodes. The load started at zero and went up to 100 N. For each load case, the structured was analyzed by KhepriFrame3DD and the computed truss node displacements were used to show the shape of the truss under load. To make the displacement more obvious, we applied a factor of 100. This means that the actual truss deformation is one hundred times smaller than what is illustrated. The following movie shows the truss behavior under increasing load:</p> <video width=700  controls> <source src="http://web.ist.utl.pt/antonio.menezes.leitao/ADA/SuperComputingFilms/VDomeTrussRibsDeform2.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video> <p>The entire analysis, containing 200 different load cases whose results were rendered in FHD, required 1h46m to generate. One problem we had was that each structural analysis was entirely sequential and, thus, could not benefit from multiple CPUs or multiple computing nodes. On the other hand, it is relevant to mention that the largest fraction of the time &#40;around 99&#37;&#41; is spent rendering, which is already highly parallelized and takes full advantage of the 96 CPUs available.</p> <p>Another experiment was the addition of an horizontal force, which we established as one tenth of the vertical one. This small addition considerably impacts the structural behavior of the truss. The following movie compares the base load case, with this one.</p> <video width=700  controls> <source src="http://web.ist.utl.pt/antonio.menezes.leitao/ADA/SuperComputingFilms/WDomeTrussRibsDeform23.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video> <p>The second analysis, again with 200 load cases, took 1h48m. Although we did the experiments one after the other, it would have been possible to run them in two different computing nodes, making the total time just the maximum of both times, i.e., 1h48m instead of their sum, i.e., 3h34.</p> <p>On a further experiment, we studied the impact of the truss bars radius on the structural performance. The following movie illustrates the behavior of a truss that is loaded with a constant force of -10N on each truss node and where the radius of the truss bars goes from 3cm to 5mm. The entire analysis was completed in 1h03m.</p> <video width=700  controls> <source src="http://web.ist.utl.pt/antonio.menezes.leitao/ADA/SuperComputingFilms/DomeTrussRibsDeformRadiusW35.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video> <p>To have a different perspective on the truss behavior, observe the following movie that more clearly shows the radius reduction and its effect on the structure shape under load.</p> <video width=700  controls> <source src="http://web.ist.utl.pt/antonio.menezes.leitao/ADA/SuperComputingFilms/DomeTrussRibsDeformRadius.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video> <p>This previous analysis required 1h04m to produce. Again, it would have been possible to explore multiple computing nodes, to make multiple analysis to be executed at the same time. In fact, the limitation is not on the computing power available but, instead, on the human power available, as we the motivation for further analyses only emerges after studying the results of the previous one.</p> <p>Finally, we decided to do a different design space exploration: this time, instead of exploring one design parameter, we explored different truss topologies. The difference lies in the bracings between nodes, as illustrated in the following image:</p> <img src="/SupercomputingKhepri/output/TrussTopology.png" alt=""> <p>Although the two imagens on the right look very similar, they are different, as the one at the bottom has two independent bar connecting alternating nodes, while the top one has one extra node on the crossing between bars, effectively making them four independent bars connected at that extra node. This has a considerable effect on the truss behavior as it makes it much more difficult to resist compressive forces.</p> <p>The behavior of the different truss topologies is illustrated in the following movie. All trusses were subjected to the same load case, an increasingly larger vertical force and an horizontal force that is one tenth of the vertical one. Remember that the displacement is amplified by a factor of 100.</p> <video width=700  controls> <source src="http://web.ist.utl.pt/antonio.menezes.leitao/ADA/SuperComputingFilms/WDomeTrussRibsDeform6789.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video> <p>Seen from the inside of the structure, the behavior seems a bit more impressive, as is visible in the following movie:</p> <video width=700  controls> <source src="http://web.ist.utl.pt/antonio.menezes.leitao/ADA/SuperComputingFilms/DomeTrussRibsDeform6789.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video> <p>It is interesting to note that with one exception, these different topologies take approximately the same time to evaluate, slightly under one hour. The exception is the structure at the top right corner, which has significantly more bars and nodes than the others, which cause KhepriFrame3DD to take an inordinate amount of time to analyze the structure &#40;7h33m&#41;. Just in case, we repeated the four simulations twice but the results came almost exactly the same.</p> <p>Given that the structural analysis is single threaded but is chained with the rendering, which is multi-threaded, the best we can do is to analyze multiple cases in different computing nodes. The total time, though, is the maximum, that is, 7h33.</p> <h2 id=optimization ><a href="#optimization" class=header-anchor >Optimization</a></h2> <p>The next set of experiments measured the potential gains that parallelization could provide to optimization problems. To focus on the optimization itself, we used an objective function that was not parallelized. More specifically, the case study was the optimization of the structural properties of the previous truss, measured by the maximum displacement of all its nodes. The variable vector to optimize is the location of the truss&#39; center, i.e., the point at the top where all truss legs join.</p> <p>We started by considering only the X and Y location of the truss&#39; center, fixing its height. This means that we will have two variables to optimize. The objective function landscape is a very simple one, as represented in the following plot where we show the maximum displacement of the truss nodes for different locations <span class=katex ><span

number of CPUs increases, we selected optimization algorithms that we knew were already parallelized. A suitable candidade is BlackBoxOptim, a parallelized optimization package supporting both multi- and single-objective optimization problems using meta-heuristics algorithms.</p> <p>BlackBoxOptim supports both multithreaded and parallel execution, allowing the optimization algorithm to evaluate many candidate solutions at the same time. Given that Khepri is not yet thread-safe, we opted for parallel evaluation using multiple independent processes. Following the BlackBoxOptim guidelines, we used the following template:</p> <pre><code class="julia hljs"><span class=hljs-keyword >using</span> Distributed

println(<span class=hljs-string >&quot;Solution fitness:&quot;</span>, best_fitness(res))</code></pre> <p>Given that the master process is responsible for running the optimization algorithm and the workers are only responsible for evaluating candidate solutions, we fixed the seed of the master&#39;s random number generator so that we could repeat the experiments with a different number of workers but without changing the sequence of steps taken. This ensures that the optimization always finds the same solution after the same number of steps.</p> <p>Note that BlackBoxOptim requires, first, that we setup the optimization problem, using the <code>bbsetup</code> function. Here, the <code>displacement</code> argument is the function to minimize. It measures the maximum displacement of a truss&#39; node. The next argument specifies the optimization method to use, in this case, we selected the Exponential Natural Evolution Strategy &#40;xNES&#41;. Then, we specify the domain of the two variables <span class=katex ><span class=katex-mathml ><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=katex-html  aria-hidden=true ><span class=base ><span class=strut  style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">x</span></span></span></span> and <span class=katex ><span class=katex-mathml ><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>y</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">y</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=katex-html  aria-hidden=true ><span class=base ><span class=strut  style="height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">y</span></span></span></span> representing the projection on the <span class=katex ><span class=katex-mathml ><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>X</mi><mi>Y</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">XY</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=katex-html  aria-hidden=true ><span class=base ><span class=strut  style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.22222em;">Y</span></span></span></span> plane of the point where all the truss&#39; arcs join. Note that this is a square that fits inside the slab that supports the truss. We also specify the maximum number of objective function evaluations and the set of workers that will be used to compute those evaluations.</p> <p>After the setup, the function <code>bboptimize</code> does the job of coordinating the workers, assigning them candidate solutions to evaluate, collecting the results and deciding the evolution of the set of candidates.</p> <p>As before, we tested the script using an increasing number of workers and we did three independent runs to smooth out the noise. We allowed the optimization to do a maximum number of objective function evaluations of 1000. In all cases, the solution found was the same, as expected from the fixed random seed used that forced the optimization to be deterministic. The following table presents the mean time spent in the optimization process for different numbers of processes. Again, note that the number of workers is one less than the number of processes.</p> <div id=fdpqqr  style="width:600px;height:350px"></div> <script> var fig = {"layout":{"showlegend":false,"xaxis":{"showticklabels":true,"gridwidth":0.5,"tickvals":[0.5,1.5,2.5,3.5,4.5,5.5,6.5,7.5,8.5],"visible":true,"ticks":"inside","range":[-0.44384,9.44384],"domain":[0.0,0.0],"tickmode":"array","linecolor":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.000)","showgrid":true,"title":"Processes","mirror":false,"tickangle":0,"showline":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.100)","titlefont":{"color":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.000)","family":"sans-serif","size":15},"tickcolor":"rgb(0, 0, 0)","ticktext":["2","4","8","16","32","48","64","80","96"],"zeroline":false,"type":"-","tickfont":{"color":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.000)","family":"sans-serif","size":11},"zerolinecolor":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.000)","anchor":"y"},"paper_bgcolor":"rgba(255, 255, 255, 1.000)","annotations":[],"height":330,"margin":{"l":0,"b":20,"r":0,"t":20},"plot_bgcolor":"rgba(255, 255, 255, 1.000)","yaxis":{"showticklabels":true,"gridwidth":0.5,"tickvals":[0.0,5000.0,10000.0,15000.0,20000.0,25000.0],"visible":true,"ticks":"inside","range":[-804.54171,27622.598710000002],"domain":[1.0,1.0],"tickmode":"array","linecolor":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.000)","showgrid":true,"title":"Time (s)","mirror":false,"tickangle":0,"showline":true,"gridcolor":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.100)","titlefont":{"color":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.000)","family":"sans-serif","size":15},"tickcolor":"rgb(0, 0, 0)","ticktext":["0","5.0×10³","1.0×10⁴","1.5×10⁴","2.0×10⁴","2.5×10⁴"],"zeroline":false,"type":"-","tickfont":{"color":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.000)","family":"sans-serif","size":11},"zerolinecolor":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.000)","anchor":"x"},"width":640},"frames":[],"data":[{"xaxis":"x1","fill":"tozeroy","yaxis":"y1","x":[0.09999999999999998,0.09999999999999998,0.9,0.9,0.09999999999999998,0.09999999999999998],"showlegend":true,"mode":"lines","fillcolor":"rgba(0, 154, 250, 1.000)","name":"y1","legendgroup":"y1","line":{"color":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.000)","dash":"solid","width":1},"y":[26818.057,0.0,0.0,26818.057,26818.057,26818.057],"type":"scatter","hoverinfo":"none"},{"xaxis":"x1","fill":"tozeroy","yaxis":"y1","x":[1.1,1.1,1.9,1.9,1.1,1.1],"showlegend":false,"mode":"lines","fillcolor":"rgba(0, 154, 250, 1.000)","name":"y1","legendgroup":"y1","line":{"color":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.000)","dash":"solid","width":1},"y":[13320.896666666666,0.0,0.0,13320.896666666666,13320.896666666666,13320.896666666666],"type":"scatter","hoverinfo":"none"},{"xaxis":"x1","fill":"tozeroy","yaxis":"y1","x":[2.1,2.1,2.9,2.9,2.1,2.1],"showlegend":false,"mode":"lines","fillcolor":"rgba(0, 154, 250, 1.000)","name":"y1","legendgroup":"y1","line":{"color":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.000)","dash":"solid","width":1},"y":[6818.336,0.0,0.0,6818.336,6818.336,6818.336],"type":"scatter","hoverinfo":"none"},{"xaxis":"x1","fill":"tozeroy","yaxis":"y1","x":[3.1,3.1,3.9,3.9,3.1,3.1],"showlegend":false,"mode":"lines","fillcolor":"rgba(0, 154, 250, 1.000)","name":"y1","legendgroup":"y1","line":{"color":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.000)","dash":"solid","width":1},"y":[6755.592333333333,0.0,0.0,6755.592333333333,6755.592333333333,6755.592333333333],"type":"scatter","hoverinfo":"none"},{"xaxis":"x1","fill":"tozeroy","yaxis":"y1","x":[4.1,4.1,4.9,4.9,4.1,4.1],"showlegend":false,"mode":"lines","fillcolor":"rgba(0, 154, 250, 1.000)","name":"y1","legendgroup":"y1","line":{"color":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.000)","dash":"solid","width":1},"y":[6770.106,0.0,0.0,6770.106,6770.106,6770.106],"type":"scatter","hoverinfo":"none"},{"xaxis":"x1","fill":"tozeroy","yaxis":"y1","x":[5.1,5.1,5.9,5.9,5.1,5.1],"showlegend":false,"mode":"lines","fillcolor":"rgba(0, 154, 250, 1.000)","name":"y1","legendgroup":"y1","line":{"color":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.000)","dash":"solid","width":1},"y":[6747.997,0.0,0.0,6747.997,6747.997,6747.997],"type":"scatter","hoverinfo":"none"},{"xaxis":"x1","fill":"tozeroy","yaxis":"y1","x":[6.1,6.1,6.9,6.9,6.1,6.1],"showlegend":false,"mode":"lines","fillcolor":"rgba(0, 154, 250, 1.000)","name":"y1","legendgroup":"y1","line":{"color":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.000)","dash":"solid","width":1},"y":[6853.522,0.0,0.0,6853.522,6853.522,6853.522],"type":"scatter","hoverinfo":"none"},{"xaxis":"x1","fill":"tozeroy","yaxis":"y1","x":[7.1,7.1,7.9,7.9,7.1,7.1],"showlegend":false,"mode":"lines","fillcolor":"rgba(0, 154, 250, 1.000)","name":"y1","legendgroup":"y1","line":{"color":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.000)","dash":"solid","width":1},"y":[6811.0076666666655,0.0,0.0,6811.0076666666655,6811.0076666666655,6811.0076666666655],"type":"scatter","hoverinfo":"none"},{"xaxis":"x1","fill":"tozeroy","yaxis":"y1","x":[8.1,8.1,8.9,8.9,8.1,8.1],"showlegend":false,"mode":"lines","fillcolor":"rgba(0, 154, 250, 1.000)","name":"y1","legendgroup":"y1","line":{"color":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.000)","dash":"solid","width":1},"y":[6735.674333333333,0.0,0.0,6735.674333333333,6735.674333333333,6735.674333333333],"type":"scatter","hoverinfo":"none"}]};

It is less clear why the previous experiments did not show the same initial speedup. In the end, we were not impressed with the speedups that we obtained from all of these experiments. We can conclude that for the specific algorithms and optimization problems that we studied, there is no justification to use more than 8 processes. The good news is that this is the typical number of computing threads that are currently available in most off-the-shelf hardware. The bad news is that it does not make the case for the use of supercomputers which have much larger numbers of threads.</p> <p>There is, however, a silver lining. In all of these experiments, we used just one computing node for each specific algorithm, but we managed to use different computing nodes for different experiments. This means that, in practice, the time needed to do the entire set of experiments is not the sum of the times needed for each experiment but the maximum of all those times, subject to the limitation that we could only explore four computing nodes and to the fact that there were other jobs competing for those resources. Nevertheless, it demonstrates the potential gains that can be obtained when addressing the No Free Lunch theorem, which states that no optimization algorithm is better than all others in all cases. The consequence is that multiple algorithms need to be tested and the ability to use multiple computing nodes allows these tests to be done simultaneously, thus taking no more time than the time needed to run the slowest of them.</p> <h2 id=rendering ><a href="#rendering" class=header-anchor >Rendering</a></h2> <p>Rendering is a extremely time-consuming task. At the same time, it is one that can have significant speedups when there are sufficient resources available. In this section, we experimented different rendering tasks and measured the effective gains.</p> <h3 id=rendering_an_image ><a href="#rendering_an_image" class=header-anchor >Rendering an Image</a></h3> <p>In this experiment, we tested the scalability of the popular raytracer POVRay. This is one of Khepri&#39;s rendering backends and, therefore, we used Khepri to generate the following 3D structure containing different materials &#40;metal, glass, etc&#41;:</p> <img src="/SupercomputingKhepri/output/DomeTrussRibs.png" alt=""> <p>Usually, Khepri handles POVRay without any help from the user but, in this experiment, we did not want to include the time it takes for Khepri to generate the information to POVRay and then to start it. Therefore, we took the input files generated by Khepri for POVRay and we tested them directly.</p> <p>We knew that, by default, POVRay uses all available CPUs to divide most of the raytracing process between them. However, we found it difficult to make it use fewer CPUs, even when we specified so on the batch script. We were able to solve the problem by using the <code>Work_Threads</code> option of POVRay, which specifies the number of threads that it should use. The corresponding Slurm script looked like this:</p> <pre><code class="bash hljs"><span class=hljs-meta >#!/bin/bash</span>

After that, the gains appear to be marginal. In the case of the large rendering task, despite the fluctuations, we were able to reach a speedup of almost 65 and the trend line shows that there are even bigger potential speedups waiting for us. In fact, POVRay can take advantage of 512 threads, so we are still a long way away from that limit.</p> <h3 id=rendering_a_movie ><a href="#rendering_a_movie" class=header-anchor >Rendering a Movie</a></h3> <p>A movie is made of a sequence of images and, therefore, rendering a movie implies rendering multiples images. For smooth visualization, we should use a minimum of 30 frames per second, which means that a short 10-seconds movie requires at least 300 rendered images. If we further assume that the images should be in Full HD, i.e., using 1920x1080 pixels, then it becomes obvious that even a short movie can take a huge amount of time on a normal computer. In the recent past, we did several of these movies and it was not unusual to wait days or weeks for the completion of the rendering process.</p> <p>As we saw in the previous section, using the Cirrus supercomputer the time need to render each frame becomes acceptable and thus, it is tempting to just generate all of the needed frames in sequence. This relieves the programmer of having to coordinate multiple processes. The following study of daylight, made of 157 frames at a resolution of 1024x768, was entirely done in 79m36s:</p> <video width=700  controls> <source src="http://web.ist.utl.pt/antonio.menezes.leitao/ADA/SuperComputingFilms/DomeTrussRibsDay-film.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video> <p>Given that the speedup gets bigger at higher resolutions, we attempted the same but now using 1920x1080 pixels and for a smoother effect, 391 frames:</p> <video width=700  controls> <source src="http://web.ist.utl.pt/antonio.menezes.leitao/ADA/SuperComputingFilms/DomeTrussRibsDayFHD-film.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video> <p>This time, it took 797m30s and, fitting the typical overnight rendering job.</p> <p>We saw in the previous experiment that POVRay will explore all available threads to render just one frame and, so, there are no more computational resources available that we can use to further speedup the process. If we start more POVRay processes on the computing node, the computing resources will be divided among them and, therefore, we will slowdown all of them. However, the Cirrus supercomputer has multiple computing nodes. This means that although it might not be possible to speedup up the rendering of one image beyond the 96 threads available in one computing node, it is possible to speedup the rendering of a sequence of images by dividing the sequence among all available computing nodes. In our case, we were allowed to use four computing nodes and, although we did not experimented it because there were other jobs running that made it impossible to reserve all computing nodes for ourselves, it is clear that it would be possible to divide the rendering tasks among the four different computing nodes to achieve a further 4x speedup, allowing the rendering of a Full HD movie to achieve a speedup of 250.</p> <p>Another, easier to do, experiment is the production of different movies. In this case, there is no need to coordinate the different computing nodes as each one can do a completely separate job. To prove this, we did a study on the different turbidity degrees of the atmosphere. First, we wrote a small Khepri script that would receive the turbidity degree as a command line argument and would generate a 400-frames movie of an animated object that is being viewed by a camera that rotates around it:</p> <pre><code class="julia hljs"><span class=hljs-keyword >using</span> KhepriPOVRay

The results are the following:</p> <video width=700  controls> <source src="http://web.ist.utl.pt/antonio.menezes.leitao/ADA/SuperComputingFilms/RotatingGrowingSpheres.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video> <p>The film with white background took 218m15.151s while the one with the black background took real 89m36.919s. This is one example where dividing the work among to computing nodes does not provide as much benefit as we would like because one of the videos takes much longer to produce than the other. Nevertheless, it still saves almost one and a half hour in a job that would take 5 hours to complete, a still significant 30&#37; reduction.</p> <p>Finally, given that the focus was architecture, we decided to repeat a series of videos that we did in the past, at a time where we spent weeks rendering images that, in some cases, would take one hour for each frame. Given the differences in the available software, it is not possible to exactly replicate the images, as the rendering engine is necessarily different. However, it can give a sense of the trade-offs between speed and image quality.</p> <p>The first video shows a parametric exploration of Astana&#39;s National Library &#40;the video was &#39;filmed&#39; at Full HD resolution but was reduced to half its size to facilitate viewing&#41;:</p> <video width=700  controls> <source src="http://web.ist.utl.pt/antonio.menezes.leitao/ADA/SuperComputingFilms/Astana_rubber-film.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video> <p>For another example:</p> <video width=700  controls> <source src="http://web.ist.utl.pt/antonio.menezes.leitao/ADA/SuperComputingFilms/2_Tracking-Cyl.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video> <h3 id=evolution ><a href="#evolution" class=header-anchor >Evolution</a></h3> <p>We saw that supercomputers can have a dramatic effect on the time needed for rendering tasks. By parallelizing the rendering of a single image through the multi-processing capabilities of a computing node and then parallelizing the rendering of multiple imagens through the use of multiple computing nodes, it becomes possible to achieve very large speedups.</p> <p>At the same time, it is relevant to consider that even commodity hardware, nowadays, can efficiently run multiple threads in parallel. This means that the speedups obtained in the previous experiments must be contrasted not with the minimum computing power that the supercomputer can provide but, instead, with the current computing power that is available almost everywhere. It is in this analysis that the results do not look as good as they seemed. As a reference, using the maximum computing power available on one computing node, i.e., 96 execution threads, we managed to render the 1920x1024 image in an average of 110.3 seconds. For comparison, a 2017 AMD ThreadRipper 1950X workstation providing 16 cores/32 threads renders that same image in 615.5 seconds, which represents a speedup of only 5.6. For an even more depressing comparison, a 2015 Intel 4 cores/8 threads i7-6700K CPU that costs around 250 EUR can render the same image in 1946.4 seconds while doing other useful tasks at the same time. Although the supercomputer gives us a speedup of 17.6, just the CPU costs 18 times more. The ratio cost/performance seems to be, at best, constant.</p> <p>Despite the cost, the supercomputer does make the rendering task more feasible. We decided to test some additional examples that, in the past, were almost impractical. As a first example, in 2010, the following image, by Prateek Karandikar, took 16 hours and 19 seconds to render on an Intel Pentium 1.8GHz machine with 1GB RAM.</p> <img src="/SupercomputingKhepri/output/Photon.png" alt=""> <p>The supercomputer could generate the same image in 51 <em>seconds</em>, which is more than three orders of magnitude faster.</p> <p>As another example, consider the classical POVRay Hall-of-Fame <em>Pebbles</em> example, which is entirely procedurally generated:</p> <img src="/SupercomputingKhepri/output/pebbles.png" alt=""> <p>According to its author, this image took 4.5 days to render on an Athlon 5600&#43;. We generated the exact same image on the supercomputer in 2h49m. This is a speedup of almost 40, which opens the door to other ideas. One was to use the exact same POVRay program do a short movie just by changing the camera. The result is not very smooth but it gives an idea of what becomes possible:</p> <img src="http://web.ist.utl.pt/antonio.menezes.leitao/ADA/SuperComputingFilms/PebblesZoomInOutFilm.gif" alt=""> <h2 id=conclusions ><a href="#conclusions" class=header-anchor >Conclusions</a></h2> <p>Despite the clear advantages of having very large computing resources available, there are some drawbacks to the use of those resources. The first is on the software side, as programs that require a graphical user interface can hardly run in a supercomputing environment. Even if the software does not have that particular requirement, it usually needs to be adapted to be able to run. Given the differences between operating systems, sometimes, this is a considerable obstacle. The lack of administrative privileges also makes it difficult to install software or even just the libraries needed to compile it.</p> <p>Not all software can benefit from the use of supercomputing resources. In fact, different tasks can have very different benefits from the use of those resources, including no benefits at all or even having disadvantages. Structural analysis, for example, could not benefit from the use of multiple CPUs &#40;the software was not parallelized&#41;, while rendering benefited considerably &#40;up to 65X speedup in some cases&#41;. Optimization using parallelized algorithms could benefit but only up to a point. We found that for the optimization problems we tested, there were considerable gains until we reach 8 CPUs but no gains after that. Another factor is the time it takes to launch the parallel tasks, which limits the amount of speedup that can be extracted.</p> <p>Given these limitations, it is important to plan the experiments in advance. For example, if the goal is to study the structural behavior of a building for different load cases, instead of hoping for the parallelization of the structural analysis package, we can instead parallelize the analysis of the different load cases. In the end, this approach gives the same results but it is much easier to implement, as it does not even require changing the software.</p> <h3 id=lessons_learned ><a href="#lessons_learned" class=header-anchor >Lessons Learned</a></h3> <ol> <li><p>Use a different job name for each experiment. Slurm has a great</p> </ol> <p>accounting system that gives a lot of information about everything we do but it then becomes critical to be able to distinguish between different experiments.</p> <ol start=2 > <li><p>Don&#39;t request more resources than the ones you really need. Slurm</p> </ol> <p>might be able to process your job sooner by using the capacity that is still available on a computing node that is running other jobs. However, if the nodes do not have enough free capacity to satisfy the requested resources the job will remain waiting until that capacity arrives.</p> <ol start=3 > <li><p>Resources include not only the number of nodes/tasks/cpus needed</p> </ol> <p>but also the expected time. Obviously, it should be enough to complete the job or it will be automatically cancelled when the time is over. This can be <em>very</em> annoying when a job is cancelled just before finishing what it was doing for two or three days.</p> <h3 id=future_work ><a href="#future_work" class=header-anchor >Future Work</a></h3> <p>This research is a starting point for the use of supercomputing resources to address architecture problems, leaving a large number of paths that deserve to be explored.</p> <p>One important one is to find ways to better accommodate design exploration to the supercomputing environment. We envision the possibility of pre-computing a sample of the design space in a supercomputer, where each element of the sample corresponds to a single task. Depending on the number of dimensions and the number of values considered on each dimension, this might require as few as a few dozens of CPUs, or as many as a many thousands.</p> <p>Another relevant research path is the parallelization of optimization processes. We found large limitations on the speedups that the tested algorithms could achieve and, thus, it is important to experiment other algorithms. Depending on the available computing resources, a less intelligent algorithm that makes better use of parallel computation can beat a more intelligent algorithm that is hardly parallelizable.</p> <p>A further research path is the automatic management of the supercomputing resources. To make them useful for less computer-savvy users, as is typical in architecture, it is necessary to considerably simplify their use. For example, we found that to better explore the available computing resources at each moment, we had to first check the current load on the computing nodes and then launch jobs that requested only the remaining computing resources. Another problem is the painful management of files that need to be exchanged between the user&#39;s machine and the supercomputer. We plan to find ways to eliminate these problems, e.g., through graphical user interfaces and automatic file synchronization, making the use of supercomputing resources as simple as a regular computer.</p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; António Menezes Leitão.
