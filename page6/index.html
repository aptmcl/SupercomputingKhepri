The first is on the software side, as programs that require a graphical user interface can hardly run in a supercomputing environment. Even if the software does not have that particular requirement, it usually needs to be adapted to be able to run. Given the differences between operating systems, this can be a considerable obstacle sometimes. The lack of administrative privileges also makes it difficult to install software or even just the libraries needed to compile it.</p> <p>Not all software can benefit from the use of supercomputing resources. In fact, different tasks can have very different benefits from the use of those resources, including no benefits at all or even having disadvantages. Structural analysis, for example, could not benefit from the use of multiple CPUs &#40;the software was not parallelized&#41;, while rendering benefited considerably &#40;up to 65X speedup in some cases&#41;. Optimization using parallelized algorithms also benefited but only up to a point. We found that for the optimization problems we tested, there were considerable gains until we reached 8 CPUs but no gains after that. Another factor is the time it takes to launch the parallel tasks, which limits the amount of speedup that can be extracted.</p> <p>Given these limitations, it is important to plan the experiments in advance. For example, if the goal is to study the structural behavior of a building for different load cases, instead of hoping for the parallelization of the structural analysis package, we can instead parallelize the analysis of the different load cases. In the end, this approach gives the same results but it is much easier to implement, as it does not even require changing the software.</p> <h3 id=lessons_learned ><a href="#lessons_learned" class=header-anchor >Lessons Learned</a></h3> <ol> <li><p>Use a different job name for each experiment. Slurm has a great accounting system that gives a lot of information about everything we do but it then becomes critical to distinguish between different experiments. Repeating the job names makes it more difficult to make that distinction.</p> <li><p>Do not request more resources than the ones you really need. Slurm might be able to process your job sooner by using the capacity that is still available on a computing node that is running other jobs. However, if the nodes do not have enough free capacity to satisfy the requested resources, the job will remain waiting until that capacity arrives.</p> <li><p>Resources include not only the number of nodes/tasks/CPUs needed but also the expected time. Obviously, we should estimate enough time to complete the job or it will be automatically cancelled when the time is over. It is <em>very</em> annoying to see a job being cancelled just before finishing what it was doing for two or three days.</p> </ol> <h3 id=future_work ><a href="#future_work" class=header-anchor >Future Work</a></h3> <p>This research is a starting point for the use of supercomputing resources to address architecture problems, leaving a large number of paths that deserve to be explored.</p> <p>An important one is to find ways to better accommodate design exploration to the supercomputing environment. We envision the possibility of pre-computing a sample of the design space in a supercomputer, where each element of the sample corresponds to a single task. Depending on the number of dimensions and the number of values considered on each dimension, this might require as few as a few dozens CPUs, or as many as a many thousands.</p> <p>Another relevant research path is the parallelization of optimization processes. We found large limitations on the speedups that the tested algorithms could achieve and, thus, it is important to experiment other algorithms. Depending on the available computing resources, a less intelligent algorithm that makes better use of parallel computation can beat a more intelligent algorithm that is hardly parallelizable.</p> <p>A further research path is the automatic management of the supercomputing resources. To make them useful for less computer-savvy users, as is typical in architecture, their use must be considerably simplified. For example, we found that to better explore the available computing resources at each moment, we had to first check the current load on the computing nodes and then launch jobs that requested only the remaining computing resources. Another problem is the painful management of files that need to be exchanged between the user&#39;s machine and the supercomputer. We plan to find ways to eliminate these problems, e.g., through graphical user interfaces and automatic file synchronization, making the use of supercomputing resources as simple as using a regular computer.</p> <h1></h1> <p><a href="/SupercomputingKhepri/page5/">&lt;&lt; Previous Chapter</a></p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; António Menezes Leitão.
